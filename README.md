# AI-Campfire-Conversation
A conversation between ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude, with hook ups ready for Perplexity and DeepSeek. You have an idea and you want to get validation, constructive criticism or any other input not just from one LLM but from different with ChatGPT as the moderator to distill out the key points from all of them, including ChatGPT.
I had the idea to make this because I noticed the personalities of each LLM seem to be different. I like them to the following. ChatGPT is SoCal Gemini's Norcal, Bay Area tech hub and Claude is New York City. With that in mind it creates different results and I wanted to make sure that through a moderator I was distilling out what the key points were, and not being biased or steered by one style of LM or another. I used Replit to generate the code and UI. While there are multiple rounds of discussion possible using just one seems to work just fine.
